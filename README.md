# Corrugated Cardboard Boxes Dataset

This Corrugated-Cardboard-Boxes-Dataset comprises images collected from online purchases, focusing on parcels and their surroundings at courier stations. Each image is taken head-on, using a smartphone camera. After gathering intact, and undamaged samples, deliberate damage was introduced to different parcels. This damage included punctures, scratches, dropping from heights, stepping on, and applying pressure with heavy objects. The dataset specifically captures images of the damaged parcels.
